# API Implementation and Reuse

## Overview
In this hands-on lab you will extend itineraries API implementation by reusing **aircrafts API**.  The current itineraries API responds with reservation, passenger, flight and status details.  We want to also include aircraft details.  

### Get Started

[To Return to the Home Page of TIBCO Cloud Integration, clik the **TIBCO CLOUD** icon at the top left corner]

Start by signing into TIBCO Cloud and opening Flogo.  There are many ways to navigate to Flogo but let’s start with this.

1)	Start at Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud (Home Page).
2)	Select **Integration**.
3)  Select **Integration Apps**.

### Import Application

We are going to use a prebuilt application for this hands-on lab and extend it by reusing flights API. 

1)	Select **Create/Import app**.
2)	Select **Flogo**.
3)  Select **Create New App**.
4)  On screen that opens next, click **Import app**.
5)	Navigate to where you extracted the connected customer experience artifacts and choose or drag **project/apispects/TCI/itineraries_lab/v1_itineraries_todo.json** into upload files and select **Upload**.
  Or redownload the [v1_itineraries_todo.json](https://github.com/claw-ai/Keys2Cloud/tree/master/project/apispecs/TCI/Itineraries_lab/v1_itineraries_todo.json) (tip: ctrl+click and save file)
6)  Note the Errors and Warnings screen - and then click **Import All**.
7)	Click on the default name and type ‘FlightItinerariesApp’ as the new name.
8)	You are now ready to extend this API with aircraft details.
  
### Extend and Reuse API

Let’s extend the **itineraries API** to include aircrafts details.

1)	Select **V1Itineraries_reservationid_GET**.  GET /itineraries/{reservationid} implementation will be opened.  Here you see the orchestration that invokes **reservations**, **passengers**, **flights**, and **statuses** APIs.  You are now going invoke an API call to **aircrafts** in the next steps.
2)	Hover your mouse over the gray line and select the **+** to add a new activity.
3)	From Add Activity, scroll down, select General, select Invoke REST Service. 
4)	Drag the InvokeRESTService to the right of Status.
5)	Now let’s configure the Invoke Rest Service activity.  
    1)	Let’s rename this activity.  Select InvokeRESTService, hover your mouse over the name InvokeRESTService and select the edit icon.  
    2)	Rename **InvokeRESTService** to **Aircraft**.
    3)  Select **Settings** and paste the following URL in URL field.
  `https://integration.cloud.tibcoapps.com:443/wz3dr4zotkxmqg5au6yhc526iw2otlc2/v1/aircrafts/{aircraftid}`
    4)  Now let’s map activity input.  
       - Select **Input**, expand pathParams and select aircraftid.   
       - Expand Upstream Output->Reservation->responseBody->reservation and select aircraftid.
    5) Configure the Output settings.  
       - Select **Output Settings** and paste the following schema into Response Schema.
```
{"aircraft":
    {"aircraftid":"111",
    "type":"767",
    "seatcapacity":"280"}
}
```
//
    6) Save this configured "Aircraft" step.
6) Let’s map the aircraft details into the Return activity.  
    1) Select Return activity chevron from the flow at the top (the step after the Invoke Rest Service you just added),
    2) Then expand Flow Outputs itinerary and select aircraft.  
    3) In upstream Output, expand Aircraft->responseBody, select aircraft.
    4) Click Save
  
### Start Testing

In this section we will test **itineraries API** implementation.

1)	Select **Test** button (top right).
2)	Select **Create a Launch Configuration**.
3)	Expand Activity Input under the **Mapping settings**, flowInputs->pathParams->reservationid.  And enter "AAAAA11111" into flowInputs.  Use quotes.  
4)  Select Next. 
5)  Select Run.
6)	Your Testing is complete.  Scroll down to see the response and confirm that aircraft details were added to the response.
7)	Select Stop Testing. 
8)  Close the testing window.
9)  Click arrow  on left to return to the FlightItinerariesApp main page. 
  
### Push App

In this section we are going to push the itineraries app to the cloud and test the live endpoints.

1)	Select **Push** app button to the right of the page.
2)	The itineraries app will be pushed to the cloud.
3)  Change the number of instances to 1 and click **Scale** button.
4)  Message will be changing to Running.
5)	Test your live endpoint by selecting **Endpoints** tab, then click the **Test** link.
6)  Expand the GET request and click **Try it out**.
7)	Enter AAAAA11111 for reserverationid input parameter and select **Execute**.
  
### Summary
In this exercise you imported an application and extended by reusing **aircrafts API**.  You performed a local test and pushed the application to the cloud.  You finshed by testing the application's live endpoints.
