# Mock API

## Overview
In this hands-on lab you will create a mock API for passengers.  It’s really a good idea to fake it before you make it.  Teams can create mock services to indicate what they need an API to do.  Architects and developers can get a head start on their work by leveraging the Mock API well before the implemented API goes into production; and can also provide feedback and changes earlier in the API development lifecycle. Supports continuous planning, development, and testing.

### Get Started

[To Return to the Home Page of TIBCO Cloud Integration, clik the **TIBCO CLOUD** icon at the top left corner]

Start by having your API Specs group **CustomerExperienceAirport** open.  There are many ways to open your spec group.  Here are the steps starting from *Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud*.

1)	Start at Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud.
2)	Select APIs.
3)	Select API specs, CustomerExperienceAirport.

### Create Mock App

We are now going to create a mock application for passengers from your passenger API spec.

1)	Navigate to **passengers**, hover over passengers in the API spec list, select <sub><img src="images/vellipse.png" width=18/></sub> and choose Create Mock app.
2)	Give your mock app a name, **v2_passengers** and select Create.
3)	Your mock app v2_passengers will be created and deployed to the cloud.
  
### Test

This next section will show you how to test your mock application end points.

1)	Select the down-arrow next to "1 Endpoint" and choose view and test.
2)	Select Try it out! Under GET /v2/passengers.
3)	Your request for passengers will return a list of passengers.
4)	Let’s try testing /v2/passengers/{passengerid}.  Select or scroll down to /v2/passengers/{passengerid}.  Enter 11111 in passengerid parameter and select Try it out!
5)	Your request for /v2/passengers/11111 will return passenger details.
  
### Summary

Creating Mock Apps is as simple as a mouse click on TIBCO Connected Intelligence Cloud.  In this section we leveraged the passengers API and generated and deployed a mock passengers app to the cloud and tested the API end point.
